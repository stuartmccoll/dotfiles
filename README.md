# Dotfiles

## What is this?

This is my personal dotfiles repository used to keep my dotfiles under source control and as a way of duplicating my setup across multiple machines.

## Installation

* Clone this repository to `~/dotfiles`.
* Run the command `ln -s <cloned_dir>/.vimrc ~/.vimrc` where <cloned_dir> is the directory in which the repository was cloned into. This will install the necessary symbolic links.

## With thanks to...

The [GitHub dotfiles project](https://dotfiles.github.io/) and the open source community.
